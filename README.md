# Analysis of Global Air Quality Index (AQI)

**Objective:** Perform an exploratory data analysis to understand air quality patterns across different cities and countries

**Main Dataset:** World Air Quality Index Project Data (OpenAQ)

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Import the dataset and parse dates.
   - Handle missing data and outliers.

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Calculate average AQI levels for different pollutants.
   - Identify cities with the highest and lowest air quality.

3. Data Visualisation
   - Create line graphs showing AQI trends over time.
   - Use bar charts to compare AQI levels across cities.
   - Generate geographic maps to visualise air quality distribution.
4. Insights and Reporting
   - Summarise key findings on air pollution trends.
   - Discuss possible factors influencing air quality.
